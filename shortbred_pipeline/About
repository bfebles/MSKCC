This pipeline takes human decontaminated reads in merged R1 and R2 metagenomic samples. 
It creates short markers that uniquely represent each colibactin(bacterial toxin) gene family.
It maps the decontaminated metagenomic samples to the colibactin markers. This mapping process identifies which colibactin genes are present in the sample.
It produces output files that include information about the identified colibactin genes, their abundance, and other related data in each sample.
It uses bash script to modify the output files for downstream analysis.
